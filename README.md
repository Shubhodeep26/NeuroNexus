## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

Want to make it your own? Here‚Äôs how:

- **Change Colors**:  
  Modify `--primary-color` or `--background-page` variables at the top of the `<style>` section.
  
- **Adjust Animations**:  
  Tweak animation speed by editing duration values in the CSS animations.

- **Resize the Form**:  
  Change the `max-width` property of `.form-container` to make the form larger or smaller.

- **Use a Different Font**:  
  Update the `font-family` property in the CSS.

## ‚ö° Setup Requirements

- Just a web browser. No installations or extra files needed.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Things to Know

- The form does **not** validate input values (no JavaScript or backend).
- It does **not** actually submit form data; the `action="/submit"` attribute is a placeholder.
- For real data handling, you would need to integrate a backend (e.g., PHP, Node.js, Python).
