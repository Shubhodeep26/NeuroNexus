## 📂 Files

- `google_form_like_web_form.html` – The main file containing **both HTML structure** and **embedded CSS styling**.

---

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Download or copy the `google_form_like_web_form.html` file.
2. Open the file in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
3. Fill out the form fields and click **Submit**.
   - Note: The form does not send any data, as there is no backend server connected.

## 🛠️ Customization

Want to make it your own? Here’s how:

- **Change Colors**:  
  Modify `--primary-color` or `--background-page` variables at the top of the `<style>` section.
  
- **Adjust Animations**:  
  Tweak animation speed by editing duration values in the CSS animations.

- **Resize the Form**:  
  Change the `max-width` property of `.form-container` to make the form larger or smaller.

- **Use a Different Font**:  
  Update the `font-family` property in the CSS.

---

## ⚡ Setup Requirements

- Just a web browser. No installations or extra files needed.

---

## ⚠️ Things to Know

- The form does **not** validate input values (no JavaScript or backend).
- It does **not** actually submit form data; the `action="/submit"` attribute is a placeholder.
- For real data handling, you would need to integrate a backend (e.g., PHP, Node.js, Python).
